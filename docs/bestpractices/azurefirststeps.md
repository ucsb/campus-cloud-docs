## Azure Subscription First Steps
For teams or individuals that are creating an Azure account, here are some essential first steps that you should take.
This guide assumes your account is a UCSB Campus Cloud account and that you have received an email from the Campus Cloud team saying your account is now ready for use.

1. **Log in to your Azure Subscription**. The Campus Cloud team has configured new accounts to use the UCSB Identity system  (netid credentials) for user authentication. Your account will come with a few pre-defined roles.
2. **Verify Billing**. [Budget alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/tutorial-acm-create-budgets) for Azure must be done by the Subscription owner.
3. **Verify Security/Compliance/Guardrails**
4. **Network Connectivity**
5. **Support for Production Services**. Groups running productions services may want to consider an [Azure support plan](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/SupportPlansBlade) beyond the included Basic plan.
