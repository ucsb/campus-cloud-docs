## Migrate to the Cloud
If you have an existing personal account in one of the following Cloud Providers, AWS, Azure or GCP, you can migrate or transition that account to UCSB’s Campus Cloud Landing Zone (LZ).  Migrating an account to the Campus Cloud LZ allows you to take advantage of the many features and benefits including significant discounts.  See - https://docs.cloud.ucsb.edu/

### FAQ - Migrating accounts to Campus Cloud LZ

#### How do I get started migrating my account ?
Please contact the Cloud Team 
See “Questions/Contacts”  at the bottom of this page → https://docs.cloud.ucsb.edu/

#### What are Cloud “personal accounts” ?  
A Cloud personal account is an account in AWS, Azure or GCP that uses a personal credit card as the payment mechanism. Personal accounts are generally NOT provisioned in UCSB’s Campus Cloud Landing Zone and therefore do not receive any of the benefits mentioned above. A  personal account may be subject to review or audit to ensure it meets UC policies and practices.  A Cloud personal account should not have a UCSB email address (ucsbnetid@ucsb.edu) associated with it.

#### What are “free” Subscriptions or Projects ?  
A free Azure Subscription or GCP Project is created without any payment mechanism. These free accounts can be created in or outside of the Campus Cloud LZ.  They are oftentimes student accounts created in the course of using free or University supported Cloud environments.

#### How do I migrate a free Subscription (Azure) to a paid Subscription?  
A Purchase Order must be created to cover the costs of the Subscription. The Subscription must be a part of the Campus Cloud LZ.

#### How do I migrate a free Project (Google) to a paid Project ?  
Currently, there is not a straightforward way to use a Purchase Order to cover Project costs. Some departments or groups have had success using a FlexCard.

#### How do I create a Google Earth Engine Project within the ucsb.edu Organization ?
There appears to be an oddity with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) app in that if a Project folder is created in advance outside of GEE it can be selected. However, one is unable to create a new Project in the Org from within GEE.  The IAM Policy  seems to exist, but GEE is unable to utilize the permissions - we are investigating this issue with Google.
