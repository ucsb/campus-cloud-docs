## AWS Account Request ERROR

AWS accounts requested using @ucsb.edu emails must be created in the Campus Cloud Landing Zone (LZ). You will revcieve an "error processing your request" notice when requesting a new AWS Account directly from AWS.

If you have requested an AWS personal or commerial account with a @ucsb.edu email address you may recieved a similar error message as what is shown below:

### AWS Account Request Restrictions
The Campus Cloud Team in early 2025 setup restrictions on AWS account requests made with a ucsb.edu email address that request an account outside of the Campus Cloud Landing Zone (LZ) environment. 

This is a broader attempt to ensure that UCSB activity is conducted in a safe, compliant environment and receives discounted pricing under the University of California Education Discount Program (EDP). This ensures that UCSB activity falls under the University of California Terms & Conditions, conforms to the UC Regentsâ€™ policies for procurement and business contracts, and reduces the financial risk to your department or division for agreements that are outside of Regental standing orders (especially with respect to third-party liability).
