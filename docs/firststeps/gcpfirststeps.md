## GCP Project First Steps
For teams or individuals that are creating a GCP account, here are some essential first steps that you should take.
This guide assumes your account is a UCSB Campus Cloud account and that you have received an email from the Campus Cloud team saying your account is now ready for use.

1. **Log in to your GCP Project**. The Campus Cloud team has configured new accounts to use the UCSB Identity system  (netid credentials) for user authentication. Your account will come with a few pre-defined roles.
2. **Verify Billing**. Set up a [Billing Budget alert](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets) for GCP.
3. **Verify Security/Compliance/Guardrails**
4. **Verify Network Connectivity**
5. **Support for Production Services**. Groups running productions services may want to consider an [GCP Customer Care Plan](https://cloud.google.com/support?hl=en) beyond the included Basic plan.
