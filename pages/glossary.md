## Glossary

*   [Campus Cloud Account](#campuscloudaccount). A Campus Cloud Account is the basic resource that is provided to users of the UCSB Campus Cloud. Strictly speaking AWS refers to this as an account, Azure as a Subscription and GCP as a Project in their Cloud environments.  The Cloud Team will refer generally to these as an Account in the Campus Cloud.

*   [Guardrails](#guardrails). A guardrail is a high-level rule that provides ongoing governance for your overall Cloud environment. It's expressed in plain language. When users perform work in an AWS account, Azure subscription or GCP project in the Campus Cloud, they're subject to guardrails. The Cloud Team will use the term "Guardrail" to generalize this governace feature that is implemented differently in each Cloud Provider.

*   [Landing Zone](#landingzone). Landing Zone is a solution that helps users more quickly set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices. The UCSB Campus Cloud uses a landing zone solution to provide a multi-account environment.

*   [Namespace](#namespace). Define a namespace.

*   [Root User](#rootuser). When you first create an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, you begin with a single identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account __root__ __user__ and is accessed by signing in with the email address that you used when creating the account.
   We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the UCSB Single Sign On Account. Securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks.
   To view the tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see [AWS Tasks That Require Root User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html).

*   [Tags](#tags). A tag is a simple label consisting of a customer-defined key and an optional value that can make it easier to manage, search for, and filter resources. Although there are no inherent types of tags, they enable customers to categorize resources by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.
