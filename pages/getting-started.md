# Getting Started

The UCSB Campus Cloud allows faculty, researchers and staff to provision and use computing resources from approved vendors that have agreements in place with the University of California.

For public cloud hosting, an approved provider is Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
Using an approved provider means that:

  * You have access to account management and solution architects — AWS staff who can assist with how to use AWS, and provide technical guidance on best practices.
  * Your vendor relationship falls under the University of California Terms & Conditions. This ensures that your agreement conforms to the UC Regents’ policies for procurement and business contracts, and reduces the financial risk to your department or division for agreements that are outside of Regental standing orders (especially with respect to third-party liability).
  

## [Procure an AWS Account](#procurement)

This is the first step for both new AWS accounts and existing AWS accounts that you wish to migrate to the Campus Cloud.
Follow the instructions below to ensure that an AWS account for UCSB business is covered under this agreement and in compliance with UC policy and applicable laws.

You will only be able to access the AWS services after all steps below are completed and the UCSB Campus Cloud team creates your AWS account.

  1. Log in to the UCSB Gateway Procurement System
  2. Complete the Campus Cloud Form.

   Please note the instructions on the left side of the form. Provide the requested information. Build in lead time for your start date. The estimated expenditure is for the duration of the PO. The expected duration is one year. The purchase order should then be renewed annually.
   If your procurement group is willing to support multi-year blankets, please limit your max duration to three years.

  3. Add the completed form to your Cart. 
     Verify that you have set the correct Commodity Code **81110000**

   and Object Code **7185**

   when you finalize your cart, check the Special Handling Code **GCT**
   
   and submit your requisition.
   
  4. The Campus Cloud team will receive your Purchase Order and contact you to schedule a meeting finalizing your account. 
  5. After this meeting you will receive an activation email from AWS:
     * Confirming that the account is set up for invoicing under the UC AWS agreement, and
     * Providing final instructions to activate your account
  6. Assign users to your Account Groups.
  7. Your account will be billed through the Master Payer Account with consolidated billing. Any monthly costs will be charged against the Purchase Order you submitted.

### Troubleshooting the Procurement Process

 Did you requisition get returned with an error? Gateway will auto-return the requistion if any of the following is incorrect:
  * Special Handling Code __GCT__
  * Commodity Code __81110000__ 
  * Object Code __7185__.
  
## Set your Account Contact Information

The Campus Cloud team will ask for the contact information for you AWS Account. For details see the [Best Practices for Contacts](docs/bestpractices/contacts).
